## Privacy
Let's use one of Rich Hickey's techniques when we talk about _Privacy_. 
Privacy comes from the Latin word _privatus_, meaning: "set apart, belonging to oneself
(not to the state), peculiar, personal." We believe we've lost touch with the
idea of "belonging to oneself" on the internet. We've grown accustomed to
trading true privacy in exchange for convenience, and we've lost touch to what
true privacy means. We've accepted only two options of privacy; being open to the
world, or open to the corporations.

## Let's go back
Let's go back to the original definition, "belonging to oneself". We think this
is important, really important. We designed Cryptic from the ground up with this
definition in mind. That's why Cryptic is built around client-side encryption.
It's a means to reach this definition of privacy.

## Open about your privacy
Funny enough, we could say whatever we think you'd like to hear, and do the
exact opposite. With most companies that might slide, but here at Cryptic anyone
in the world can hold us accountable for anything that happens with your data,
because anyone in the world can take a look right
[here](https://github.com/cryptic-io) and see the live running code.
How's that for transparency?
